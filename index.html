        <b>My final project</b> is an exploration of how Wikipedia's editing culture demonstrates a broader tension between beliefs about how knowledge re/production <i>should be</i> done and how it is <i>actually</i> done. To do this, I make a case study of Audre Lorde's Wikipedia page, examining edits made over the past twenty years—and the people who made them. In conversation with various Black feminist writers, I argue that in spite of their attempts to produce detached knowledge, Wikipedia editors inevitably project their worldviews about what information qualifies as significant, provable, or truthful. But this isn't necessarily a bad thing; rather, we might consider how Wikipedia serves as a site, both literal and rhetorical, for personal expression and modern activist praxis.
