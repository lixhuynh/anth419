      <p><strong>My final project</strong> explores how Wikipedia's editing culture demonstrates a broader tension between beliefs about how knowledge (re)production <em>should be</em> done and how it is <em>actually</em> done. I make a case study of Audre Lorde's Wikipedia page, examining edits made over the past twenty years—and the people who made them. In conversation with Black feminist writers, I argue that in spite of their attempts to produce detached knowledge, Wikipedia editors inevitably project their worldviews about what information qualifies as significant or truthful. But this isn't necessarily a bad thing; rather, we might consider how Wikipedia serves as a site, both literal and rhetorical, for personal expression and activist praxis.</p>

            <p>Audre Lorde’s Wikipedia page has humble beginnings, including only the dates of her birth and death, the body of poetry which contributed to her fame, and that great refrain of her writing: “She was a black lesbian, mother, warrior poet.”</p>

            <p>Without much content to go off of, we turn to <em>who</em> wrote this first draft: a Wikipedia editor by the name of <strong>Punkche</strong>, combining his love of punk rock and admiration of Guevara. Among Punkche’s self-descriptors is the declaration: “Until [Ronald] Reagan died, he was the largest recipient of hatred for Punkche. Now Reagan simply joins the ranks of dead murderers.” (Prior to Reagan’s death, this read “Punkche… hates Reagan more than Hitler and Stalin. Some say this is due to Reagan still being alive.”)</p>
    
            <p>Still, it’s interesting that it’s not someone like <em>Lorde</em> who features so prominently on Punkche’s profile, but <em>Reagan</em>. Is hate necessarily more powerful than love? I don’t think so. Some dead we curse loudly, spitting in the face of their legacies. But how quietly we honor others—sometimes as simply as drafting a simple Wikipedia biography.</p>

            <p>One of Wikipedia’s core content policies is a neutral point of view (NPOV), which asks editors to separate themselves from the content they contribute. But is NPOV even achievable? Donna Haraway’s concept of the god-trick critiques the notion of knowledge produced impartially. According to her, “History is a story Western culture buffs tell each other; science is a contestable text and a power field; the content is the form” (Haraway 1988, 185). Knowledge, in other words, is a social construction that cannot be disentangled from its presentation—down to the language used.</p>

            <p>In 2009, Wikipedia editor <strong>Lisasmalls</strong> replaced a description of Lorde embracing <em>femininity</em> with <em>womanhood.</em> There are two instances of self-insertion here. The first lies in the original text, which seems innocuous enough; however, the use of <em>femininity</em> indicates an implicit acceptance of a gendered construct Lorde criticized.  Femininity here is equated to feminism—a framing which reflects the original contributor’s views. But the second is in Lisasmalls’s own correction. Her claim that “lorde would NEVER have used [femininity]” speaks on Lorde’s behalf without Lorde in the conversation; it’s an imposition of her interpretation of who Lorde was.</p>
  
            <p>How do we salvage the perspective of a writer who can no longer speak? What is the difference between preserving her word and co-opting it? Leaning on Haraway, I argue there is no true NPOV; any perspective is shaped by its angle and context. But Wikipedia’s strength is in its collaborative nature: people from all walks of life are able to contribute from their own points of view. Wikipedians might establish a more holistic form of <em>sense-making</em>, then, through a truth that is not itself unmediated but instead an ongoing attempt at mediating different perspectives.</p>

            <p>Retroactive inspection of historical figures’ sexualities has become increasingly common, as the reclamation of such figures as queer allows the LGBTQ+ community of today to affirm its existence throughout history. Audre Lorde’s identity as a lesbian is uncontestable, but what remains more open to debate is the identity of her romantic partners. In 2010, contributor <strong>Jeandré du Toit</strong> removed three sentences about Dr. Gloria Joseph and a purported secret Black woman lover of Lorde’s for being unsourced. Today, Joseph has re-appeared on Lorde’s page, but any reference to this secret lover remains absent—and, inevitably, it is to this woman that my attention is drawn.</p>

            <p>Wikipedia, as a database for knowledge, is supposed to adhere to what can be proven through evidence and archive. But history is marked by absence, particularly in the margins; with Lorde, that obscurity is a consequence of both a desire for privacy and the ways in which Black lesbians have been historically erased. Saidiya Hartman grapples with that knowledge gap in “Venus in Two Acts,” writing: “How can narrative embody life in words and at the same time respect what we cannot know?... Or is narration its own gift and its own end, that is, all that is realizable when overcoming the past and redeeming the dead are not?” (Hartman 2008, 3). Her answer is critical fabulation: the re-configuration of limited narratives while leaving space for the unknown.</p>
    
            <p>Is there space for critical fabulation on Wikipedia? Maybe not in the text of a page itself. But it is significant that Wikipedia edits are made permanent through a page’s <em>own </em>history. Mention of Lorde’s Schrödinger's cat of a lover—unobservable, and therefore simultaneously present and not—will always exist in the ashes of what once was written. And “It is dangerous to be discovered” (Gumbs 2020, 12). Lorde and her lover don’t owe their relationship to the Wikipedia readers of today. There is strength in visibility, as Lorde herself emphasized in her work, but there’s power in limiting that visibility to <em>who needs to see.</em> The original text claimed Lorde’s secret lover was “widely known in the black community.” Perhaps that space for her suffices.</p>

            <p>In 2012, German sociologist Dagmar Schultz directed the film <em>Audre Lorde: The Berlin Years - 1984 to 1992.</em> Until then, Lorde’s contributions to the Afro-German movement were less well-known than her other work. Wikipedia contributor <strong>Jgzullo</strong> was the first to attempt integrating this period of Lorde’s career into her page; since then, however, the section has undergone a tug-of-war between removal and re-addition, as editors debated whether it was sufficiently relevant to keep on her page.</p>

            <p>What does it say that Schultz—a white woman—had to sunshine Lorde’s work? What does it say that even today one-third of the “Berlin years” subsection is about the film’s critical acclaim, rather than Lorde herself? Melissa Harris-Perry argues that misrecognition has negative effects on Black women’s psyche, writing, “The problem for marginal and stigmatized group members should be obvious. These citizens face fundamental and continuing threats to their opportunity for accurate recognition” (Harris-Perry 2011, 38). I extend this to legacy; both the questioning of the importance of Lorde’s contributions to the Afro-German movement and the reduction of that work to the film have detrimental effects on Lorde’s legacy.</p>
    
            <p>This isn’t a critique of the film; however, it is striking that on Lorde’s own page, contributors are more willing to cite said film than Lorde herself. A spotlight is one thing; an overreliance on outsiders to mediate Black women’s work is another. The Cite Black Women Collective states it best: “Black women have been producing knowledge since we blessed this earth. We theorize, we innovate, we revolutionize the world. We do not need mediators. We do not need interpreters” (Smith et al. 2021, 10).</p>

            <p>In the “Categorygate” controversy, Amanda Filipacchi criticized Wikipedia editors for moving female writers from the “American novelists” category to “American women novelists.” By relegating women to a more obscure corner of the site, she argued, these contributors were “mak[ing] it harder and slower for women to gain equality in the literary world” (Filipacchi 2013). While originally framed as an issue of <em>mis</em>categorization, the conversation turned to the question: is Wikipedia’s entire categorization <em>system </em>wrong?</p>

            <p>Wikipedia editor <strong>Obiwankenobi</strong>, who nominated the “Feminist critics of BDSM” category for deletion (and consequent removal from tagged pages), contributed to this debate with a quiz to identify biased categorizations of biographical pages. “Take your chances on my quiz - can you categorize without being sexist or racist? It’s hard!” they wrote. In their nomination justification, they similarly argued, “I don’t think we need this fine-grained intersection category of ‘What is your philosophy + what did you critique.’” To Obiwankenobi and many others, it seems categorization is often too blunt a tool to capture the nuances of personal identity.</p>
    
            <p>To some extent, Wikipedia categories are useful for organizing similar pages. But, as James Furner asserts, “every classification scheme is an objective representation of a subjective point of view… Almost necessarily, then, every classification scheme may be interpreted as being biased in some respect, where the bias is the inevitable reflection of designers’ preferences” (Furner 2018, 154). Any categorization system reflects its creators’ beliefs around how things <em>should be</em> classified—which may not align with how those “things” <em>wish to be </em>classified. Duana Fullwiley argues that technology contributes to this brute classification, writing, “It is the twenty-first century and humans are grappling with which features of their identities matter most, and when. Digital tools that fragment aspects of the person are now adopted to better express a limited part of what can, or cannot, be exposed” (Fullwiley 2024, ix). Audre Lorde described herself as a Black, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet—a litany of identities that inextricably shape one another. A category as broad as “African-American poet” or “Lesbian feminist” cannot truly capture her experiences.</p>
    
            <p>If categories are inherently problematic, there’s no use trying to perfect such a system. Instead, emphasis should be placed on individuals’ pages defining <em>themselves.</em> Patricia Hill Collins emphasizes the importance of ongoing dialogue in this process, writing, “Dialogues are essential because no one individual or interpretive community can wrap its arms about the magnitude of intersectionality itself” (Collins 2019, 221). People group themselves or each other with those who have <em>similar</em> experiences, but they should recognize those experiences are never the <em>same.</em></p>

            <p>Unsurprisingly, a place on the Internet that anyone can edit is often subject to vandalism. Among the typically nonsensical troll edits to Audre Lorde’s page, though, one <strong>anonymous contributor</strong>’s edit sticks out: changing “[Lorde] is best known for <em>technical mastery</em> and emotional expression” to “[Lorde] is best known for emotional expression and <em>being a woman</em>” (emphasis mine). Perhaps more bizarre was their justification: “Being a woman is much more important than technical mastery, a concept framed entirely by male patriarchal systems of artistic oppression and subjugation.”</p>

            <p>It’s not hard to see this as a thinly veiled attack on female creatives, suggesting their artistic success is solely due to gendered privilege. The harmful belief that marginalized individuals do not deserve their success is, unfortunately, nothing new. In conversation with Latoya Peterson, who argues that the Internet is founded on racist attitudes, Safiya Umoja Noble writes in <em>Algorithms of Oppression,</em> “Peterson’s allegation is consistent with what many people feel about the hostility of the web toward people of color, particularly in its anti-Blackness, which any perusal of YouTube comments or other message boards will serve up” (Noble 2018, 5). Wikipedia finds itself in a middle ground between social media sites, which make convenient the act of spreading oppressive ideologies, and the algorithmic technologies that Noble goes on to critique, which systematically reinforce such ideologies.</p>
    
            <p>Yet this same digital space provides potential for praxis. Just as the Internet has proliferated harmful ideas, it can also uplift counter-narratives. Moya Bailey calls this “digital alchemy”: “Digital alchemy shifts our attention from the negative stereotypes in digital culture to the redefinition of representations Black women are creating that provide another way of viewing their worlds” (Bailey 2021, 24). As part of her practice, Bailey created the campaign #tooFEW in 2013, which had participants promote feminist narratives on Wikipedia. Projects like these demonstrate that harm, even if it cannot be prevented, can still be mitigated.</p>

            <p>A challenge in writing about historical figures is deciding when, if ever, anachronistic language is appropriate to describe them. In 2017, an <strong>anonymous contributor</strong> edited Audre Lorde’s Wikipedia page to remove the term <em>queer</em> because “Lorde never used [the term] to describe herself.” This standard has persisted: Lorde’s page today features only five instances of the word <em>queer</em>, compared to 43 instances of <em>lesbian</em> and 14 instances of <em>gay.</em></p>

            <p>How can we reconcile with an ever-changing landscape of language? Evelynn Hammonds grapples with a similar dilemma, writing: “Given the rapidity with which new appellations are created I wondered if my new list [of identities] would still be up to date by the time the article came out. More important, does this change or any change I might make to my list convey to anyone the ways in which I am queer?" (Hammonds 1994, 301). According to Hammonds, this new language doesn’t actually engage the identities it attempts to include—but that doesn’t mean it <em>couldn’t.</em> These terms might be viewed instead as terrains that provide the potential for dialogue and knowledge production.</p>
    
            <p>In that sense, using contemporary language to talk about history doesn’t seem inherently revisionary, either. Although the words to describe something might not have existed at one time, that something can still be described with that language now. The importance is distinguishing between forcing historical figures to fit modern labels—for example, by invalidating their self-described experiences—and using said labels to engage with their experiences and connect them to today. And, I argue, Wikipedia editors are constantly navigating that line as they correct content and leave themselves open to being corrected.</p>

            <p>A running joke on the Internet is the speed with which Wikipedia editors change the tense of the page of a person who died. Audre Lorde’s passing in 1992 was little more than a decade before the creation of her Wikipedia page, so her entry has always been written in past tense. Then what does this <strong>anonymous contributor</strong>’s reversal—<em>was</em> to <em>is</em>—have to say?</p>

            <p>Wikipedia has never been just an encyclopedia. It’s built on top of the dedication of voluntary editors who bring their expertise, passions, and desire to be part of something greater. Maybe this edit is right, to some degree: Audre Lorde <em>the person</em> is dead, but Audre Lorde <em>the page</em> is ever-living. There will always be editors who leave their contributions behind, trolls who love vandalizing pages, and bots that will wipe it all clean again. Lorde’s page is in a fluctuating state of eternity: always growing, never whole, and in that way perhaps the most whole it can be.</p>

            <p>I find myself returning to Punkche creating this Wikipedia page, the infinity of his quiet labor of love. Is the state of Lorde’s page today what he imagined twenty years ago? I think of <em>Undrowned,</em> where Alexis Pauline Gumbs writes, “There are at least three ways to love you: as you were, as you are, as you will be. I love you. That means I choose all three” (Gumbs 2020, 16).  Maybe that’s the crux of Wikipedia editing: a love that is maintenance, that is addition, that is giving of oneself to make something else more complete. Maybe that’s what makes a soul infinite.</p>
