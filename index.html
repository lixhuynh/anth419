          In spite of their attempts to produce detached knowledge, Wikipedia editors inevitably project personal beliefs about what information qualifies as significant or factual. What exactly is the relationship between an editor and their edits? In particular, how does this situatedness shape their work of knowledge production?
        </p>
        <p>
          To answer these questions, I look through the history of edits to Audre Lorde's Wikipedia page. Rather than creating a biopgraphy about Lorde myself, I use her page to analyze the decisions that editors have made in constructing their own.

            <h2>APRIL 2003</h2>
            <p>
              <b>THE START</b> 
              Audre Lorde’s page has humble beginnings, perhaps owing to its situation in an Internet two decades younger. It states plainly the date of her birth and death, the body of poetry which contributed to her fame, and that great refrain of her writing: “She was a black lesbian, mother, warrior poet.”
            </p>
            <p>
              We might find more of interest considering who wrote this first draft: a Wikipedia editor who goes by the name <u>Punkche</u>, which combines his love of punk rock and admiration of Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara. Squarely in the middle of her profile, Punkche writes: “Until Reagan died, he was the largest recipient of hatred for Punkche. Now Reagan simply joins the ranks of dead murderers.” (Prior to Reagan’s death, this read “Punkche… hates Reagan more than Hitler and Stalin. Some say this is due to Reagan still being alive.”)
            </p>
            <p>
              But I think there’s something noteworthy in that it is not Lorde who features so prominently on Punkche’s profile, but Reagan. Some dead we curse loudly, spitting in the face of their legacies; Lorde’s own page will later be vandalized by haters well after her death. But how quietly we honor others—sometimes by doing something as simple as writing a Wikipedia page one morning in Colorado.

            <h2>MARCH 2009</h2>
            <p>
              <b>FEMINITY / WOMANHOOD</b> 
              March 2009 marks the start of a long debate over the language used to identify Lorde and her work. Is it right to describe her as a gay activist, when she was involved in so many other movements? How important is it to preface her identity as “American” with “Caribbean”? And—most relevantly here—is she feminist or womanist? Wikipedia editor and Maryland attorney (the latter supposedly, as most things on the Internet are) <u>Lisasmalls</u> is firm in how she thinks Lorde would have felt: Lorde would NEVER embrace femininity.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this case, it’s not an unreasonable statement to make; her writing is unequivocally critical of her feminist contemporaries for fialing to understand women’s experiences as a holistic combination of gender identity, race, a/sexuality, dis/ability, and more. Yet, I wonder how much that ambiguity gets used as a veil over a desire to express personal ideals. How do we attempt to rescue a perspective from the grave of a writer who can no longer speak? What is the difference between the preservation of her word and the co-opting of it?

            <h2>JULY 2009 / AUGUST 2010</h2>
            <p><b>LOVE AND SECRETS</b> 
              Retrospective analysis of historical figures’ sexualities has become increasingly common. In particular, the reclamation of these figures as queer allows the contemporary LGBTQ+ community to affirm its own sense of self. It’s as if to say, “We’re here, and we have been throughout history.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Audre Lorde’s identity as a lesbian is uncontestable, as in many of her works she explicitly identifies herself as such. However, what remains more open to debate is the identity of her romantic partners. In 2009, Wikipedia contributor <u>Glassnote</u> added information to Lorde’s page about her affair with sculptor and painter Mildred Thompson. Glassnote’s user page states, “On Wikipedia, I’ve written about art and artists that interest me,” which suggests a personal interest in representing the relationship between a well-known poet and an artist. A year later, contributor <u>Jeandré du Toit</u> removed three sentences about Gloria Joseph and a purported secret Black woman lover of Lorde’s. (Today, Joseph appears once again in the section about Lorde’s personal life, but any reference to this secret lover remains absent.) According to Jeandré du Toit’s user page, “I try to write from a neutral point of view.”

              These two edits, while independent of one another, represent competing viewpoints on how to approach the preservation of an individual’s personal—and, in particular, romantic—life in public discourse.

            <h2>MARCH 2013</h2>
            <p><b>IMPORTANT ENOUGH</b> 
              In 2012, German filmmaker Dagmar Schultz directed the movie Audre Lorde: The Berlin Years — 1984 to 1992. Up until then, Lorde’s contributions to the Afro-German were perhaps less well-known than her other work. This edit from Wikipedia contributor <u>Jgzullo</u> marks the first attempt at integrating this aspect of Lorde’s career into her page; however, the inclusion of this information has been contested since then. The section has undergone a sort of tug-of-war between removal and re-addition, as editors debated whether it was sufficiently relevant to keep on her page. Today, they have settled for “The Berlin years” appearing as a subheading within the section about her career. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Still, this debate brings up an important question: how do we decide whether something is important enough to feature on a Wikipedia page?
            </p>
            <p>  
              Further, what does it say that this aspect of Lorde’s life had to be illuminated by a white woman in order for Wikipedia editors to catch on?

            <h2>APRIL 2014</h2>
            <p><b>THE VIOLENCE OF CATEGORY</b> 
              In a 2013 controversy to be known as Categorygate, American novelist Amanda Filipacchi criticized Wikipedia for placing women into gendered subcategories (for example, “American women novelists” in lieu of “American novelists”). Her New York Times op-ed originally framed this as an instance of Wikipedia’s sexism, yet the topic of conversation quickly turned to the question: who exactly is “Wikipedia”? The idea that anyone, regardless of background, can contribute to Wikipedia is at odds with the reality: a majority of editors are young cisgender heterosexual white men.
            </p>
            <p>
              <u>Obiwankenobi</u>, the editor who nominated the category for deletion (and consequent removal from categorized pages), contributed to a few Wikipedia talk pages during Categorygate, including a quiz to correct potentially problematic categories on various biographical Wikipedia pages. “Take your chances on my quiz - can you categorize without being sexist or racist? It's hard!” they write.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hard—but is it impossible to categorize without being sexist or racist?
            </p>
            <p>
              In this particular instance, Obiwankenobi argues that feminist critique of BDSM is already well-documented and seldom actually defining of feminists’ beliefs, writing, “I don’t think we need this fine-grained intersection category of ‘What is your philosophy + what did you critique.’”

            <h2>AUGUST / SEPTEMBER 2016</h2>
            <p><b>TO BE KNOWN FOR</b> 
              It should hardly be a surprise that a place on the Internet that anyone can edit would be subject to vandalism. Compared to pages about contemporary controversies, however, such edits to Audre Lorde’s page have been limited to the nonsensical: changing “New York City” to “city of lesbions [sic],” or inserting “She Wrote a lot of stories that can cause you to ask questions but you can´t because DEAD!!!!” into her infobox. This edit, by an <u>anonymous contributor</u>, is probably the most absurd of them all: changing “[Lorde] is best known for technical mastery and emotional expression” to “[Lorde] is best known for emotional expression and being a woman” (emphasis my own). Perhaps more bizarre is their justification for the edit: “Being a woman is much more important than technical mastery, a concept framed entirely by male patriarchal systems of artistic oppression and subjugation.”
            </p>
            <p>
              A month passed before this edit was corrected, owed perhaps to a combination of its construction to seem innocuous to Wikipedia’s anti-vandalism algorithms and Lorde’s page simply seeing less click traffic relative to other pages. The user who catches this change, <u>Someone the Person</u>, is stern in his correction: “To call a woman famous for ‘being a woman’ is to assert that she does not deserve her fame.” But no matter how firmly we may state our corrections, the Internet is forever; buried within the edit history of Lorde’s page will always be that phrase, “known for emotional expression and being a woman.”

            <h2>OCTOBER 2017 / DECEMBER 2018</h2>
            <p><b>ANACHRONISM</b> 
              A challenge with writing about a historical figure is deciding when to use contemporary terminology to describe them.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2017, an <u>anonymous contributor</u> removed the description of Lorde as queer because “Lorde never used [the term] to describe herself.” This standard has endured through the ensuing seven years; today, Lorde’s page features exactly five instances of the word “queer,” compared to 43 instances of “lesbian” and 14 instances of “gay.”
            </p>
            <p>
              A year later, another <u>anonymous contributor</u> corrected the description of Lorde as an “intersectional feminist” to just a “feminist.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Then again, is it so wrong to use language that did not exist at the time of focus?

            <p><b>HER INFINITE SOUL</b> 
              A running joke on the Internet is the speed with which Wikipedia editors change the tense of the page of a person who died. The motivation is seldom, if ever, complex: a desire to say they were the one to make the change. Audre Lorde’s passing in 1992 was a little more than a decade before the creation of her Wikipedia page, so it has always been written in past tense. So what does one <u>anonymous contributor</u>’s one-word edit, “was” to “is,” have to tell us?
            </p>
            <p>
              Wikipedia has never just been an encyclopedia. It’s built on top of the dedication of voluntary contributors who bring their variable expertise, passions, and even their desire to be part of something bigger than themselves. Maybe this anonymous edit is right to some degree. Nothing on Wikipedia is truly permanent: there will always be more editors who leave their fingerprints behind, trolls who get a kick out of vandalizing pages, and bots who will wipe it all clean again. Audre Lorde the person is dead, of course, but Audre Lorde the page is in this way ever-living. Not immortal, but super-mortal. What makes a soul infinite, I wonder: its life, or all the things that come after?
            </p>
            <p>
              For what it’s worth, this edit is probably in good faith. It is also reverted within 24 hours.
